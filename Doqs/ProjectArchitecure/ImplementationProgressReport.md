# AliveHuman Implementation Progress Report

## Date: May 18, 2025

## Summary of Progress

We have successfully completed the initial setup and implementation of the core shared package, backend structure, and frontend components for the AliveHuman project with Web3 authentication and Polygon integration. The shared package serves as the foundation for all other components of the application, providing common utilities, models, and communication tools that are used across packages. We've also implemented the basic structure for the backend, frontend, admin dashboard, and mobile application, with significant progress in the authentication and blockchain integration modules.

## Completed Tasks

### 1. Monorepo Structure Configuration

- Established the basic monorepo structure with Yarn Workspaces
- Set up the package directory structure for all components (backend, frontend, admin, mobile)
- Created Docker configuration files for containerized development and deployment
- Configured TypeScript settings with project references for cross-package imports

### 2. Shared Package Implementation

- Created comprehensive type definitions and interfaces for all major features:
  - User models and authentication types
  - Diary feature models
  - Game and gamification system models
  - API response standardization
  
- Implemented core utilities:
  - HTTP client for RESTful API communication
  - WebSocket client for real-time features
  - Date manipulation and formatting utilities
  - Form and data validation helpers
  - Storage utilities with cross-platform abstraction
  - Text formatting and manipulation functions
  
- Set up blockchain integration foundation:
  - Wallet connection utilities
  - Address and token amount formatting
  - Network detection and validation
  
- Created application constants and configuration:
  - Environment configuration system that works across platforms
  - API endpoint constants for consistent API access
  - Application-wide constants for feature flags, timeouts, etc.

### 3. Backend Structure Implementation

- Set up NestJS application structure with modular organization
- Implemented authentication module with Web3/wallet-based authentication
- Created blockchain integration module with initial services
- Defined user management module with entity models
- Configured database connection settings
- Set up directory structure for feature modules (diary, game, notification, referral)

### 4. Frontend Initial Components

- Implemented Web3 authentication components
- Created wallet selection and connection interface
- Developed device fingerprinting and session management utilities
- Set up directory structure for all frontend features
- Implemented security mechanisms for enhanced authentication

### 5. Code Organization Standards

- Created comprehensive Code Organization Standards document
- Defined clear guidelines for shared vs. package-specific code
- Established import patterns and development workflow
- Provided examples to demonstrate proper code organization

### 6. GitHub Integration and CI/CD Pipeline

- Created GitHub repository structure with:
  - Workflow files for continuous integration (ci.yml)
  - Dependabot configuration for automated dependency updates  
  - Pull request templates for standardized contributions
  - Issue templates for bug reports and feature requests
  - Branch protection rules for code quality
  - CODEOWNERS file for code ownership
- Set up Git repository with proper configuration
- Implemented CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions
- Added scripts for streamlined GitHub workflow
- Created contributing guide and code of conduct
- Implemented automatic dependency management with Dependabot
- Set up GitLens support for enhanced Git integration in VS Code

## Next Steps

### 0. Complete GitHub and CI/CD Setup

- Push the codebase to GitHub repository
- Configure branch protection rules for main and develop branches
- Set up code owners for key directories
- Activate GitHub Actions workflows for continuous integration
- Configure GitLens for enhanced Git visualization and collaboration

### 1. Complete Backend Feature Modules

- Implement the diary feature module with CRUD operations
- Develop the game feature module with integration points
- Set up notification system with WebSocket support
- Create referral system with tracking capabilities
- Finalize database schema and migrations
- Implement remaining authentication flows

### 2. Frontend Feature Implementation

- Implement user profile and dashboard
- Develop diary interface with blockchain integration
- Create game interface with interactive elements
- Build notification center for real-time updates
- Complete authentication context and protected routes

### 3. Admin Dashboard Development

- Set up basic dashboard structure
- Implement user management interface
- Create content management system
- Develop analytics and reporting views

### 4. Mobile App Initial Setup

- Configure React Native environment
- Implement authentication flow
- Create basic navigation structure
- Integrate with shared package utilities

## Technical Notes

1. **Shared Types**: All core data models have been defined as TypeScript interfaces and are ready to be used by both the frontend and backend components.

2. **API Communication**: We've implemented a standardized approach to API communication with proper error handling and response parsing.

3. **Environment Configuration**: We've created a unified environment configuration system that works across different environments (browser, Node.js, React Native).

4. **Blockchain Integration**: Basic wallet utilities have been set up to support Ethereum/Polygon wallet integration.

5. **Authentication System**: The Web3 authentication system has been implemented with wallet signature verification and session management.

## Resource Allocation for Next Phase

For the next implementation phase, we recommend focusing on:

1. Completing the diary and game feature modules (estimated: 5-7 days)
2. Building out the frontend user interface for core features (estimated: 7-10 days)
3. Implementing the notification system with WebSockets (estimated: 3-4 days)

This phase will deliver the core user-facing functionality while additional features can be implemented in parallel.

## Issues and Challenges

1. **Environment Configuration**: We need to create proper environment files for each service based on their specific requirements.

2. **Cross-Package Dependencies**: Ensuring proper build order and dependency management between packages requires careful configuration of TypeScript project references.

3. **Feature Integration**: Coordinating the development of features across backend and frontend packages requires careful planning and communication.

## Conclusion

With the core infrastructure in place, including the shared package, backend structure, and initial frontend components, we have a solid foundation for completing the AliveHuman project. The standardized approach to types, API communication, and configuration ensures consistency across all components of the application. The next phase will focus on implementing the core features and creating a cohesive user experience.
