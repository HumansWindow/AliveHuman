# Web3 Authentication and Blockchain Migration Report

## Overview

This document summarizes the migration of the blockchain components, hot wallet functionality, and web3 authentication from the old project to the new AliveHuman monorepo.

## Components Migrated

### Blockchain Module
- Blockchain service and module files
- SHAHI token contract and storage contract
- Hot wallet services and utils
- Transaction services and ABIs
- Configuration files
- Constants and types
- Merkle tree service for token validation
- RPC load balancer for network connectivity
- Monitoring services for blockchain events

### Web3 Authentication
- Wallet authentication controllers
- Wallet authentication services
- Authentication strategies
- JWT module and configurations
- DTOs and interfaces
- Guards and decorators
- Device fingerprinting system
- Geolocation tracking
- IP detection and validation
- Session management
- Multi-wallet support

### Wallet Module
- Wallet entities
- Wallet service and controller
- Wallet connection management
- Device-wallet association

### Minting System
- Token minting service
- User minting queue service
- First-time and annual minting functions
- Batch minting capabilities
- Admin minting functions
- Minting eligibility verification
- Token expiry management
- Wallet module configuration

## Configuration Setup

The following environment variables have been configured:

### Blockchain Configuration
- RPC URLs for Ethereum, Polygon, and Mumbai networks
- Fallback RPC URLs
- Contract addresses for SHAHI token
- Hot wallet address and encryption key
- Minting configuration
- Batch minting settings
- Token expiry parameters

### Authentication Configuration
- JWT secret and expiry times
- Wallet nonce expiry time
- Device verification settings
- Geolocation validation parameters

### Security Configuration
- Device fingerprinting parameters
- IP validation rules
- Wallet-device association limits

## Integration with App Module

The blockchain module has been properly integrated with the app module to ensure all components work together seamlessly. This includes:

- Importing the BlockchainModule in the main app.module.ts
- Configuring the blockchain configuration provider
- Setting up proper dependency injection for all services
- Integrating with the users module for wallet information
- Connecting with the auth module for wallet authentication

## Security Features

The web3 authentication system includes several security features:

### Device Fingerprinting
- Collects browser and device information
- Creates a unique fingerprint for each device
- Validates device authenticity during authentication

### Geolocation Tracking
- Collects precise location data with user permission
- Validates location changes for suspicious activity
- Helps prevent unauthorized access from unusual locations

### IP Detection
- Tracks and validates IP addresses
- Detects suspicious IP changes
- Helps identify potential session hijacking attempts

### Wallet-Device Association
- Limits each device to a single wallet address
- Prevents malicious usage of multiple wallets from one device
- Enhances security for token minting operations

## Testing

A test script has been created at `scripts/test-blockchain.sh` to verify:
- Blockchain connection functionality
- Hot wallet initialization and access
- Balance checking
- Network switching capability
- RPC URL fallback functionality
- Token minting operations (optional)

## Token Minting System

The SHAHI token minting system has been migrated with the following features:

### Minting Types
- First-time minting for new users (0.5 SHAHI)
- Annual minting for returning users (0.5 SHAHI per year)
- Admin minting for special distributions
- Batch minting for gas optimization

### Security Features
- Merkle proof verification for first-time minting
- Device fingerprinting validation
- Signature-based verification for annual minting
- Device-wallet association validation
- Queue-based processing to prevent double-minting
- Automatic token expiry system

## Next Steps

1. Update `.env` with actual values for:
   - Hot wallet address and encryption key
   - Contract addresses
   - RPC URLs for mainnet and testnet

2. Run the test script to verify all components work correctly:
   ```
   ./scripts/test-blockchain.sh
   ```

3. Test the web3 authentication flow in the application.

4. Update or add any additional blockchain-specific environment variables needed.

## Notes

- All components have been migrated to align with the monorepo structure
- Configuration follows the AliveHuman project standards
- The blockchain module is integrated with NestJS configuration system
# task we should do 
-Update the .env file with your actual values for hot wallet address, encryption key, contract   addresses, and RPC URLs
- Run the test script to verify everything works correctly: test-blockchain.sh
- Test the web3 authentication flow in your application
