   - Set up deployment workflows
   - Implement database migration strategy
   - Add security measures
   - Apply performance optimizations

## AI-Assisted Implementation

When using AI to help implement these components:

1. Start with high-level architecture prompts from each component file
2. Break down complex modules into smaller, focused implementation tasks
3. For each feature:
   - Begin with interfaces and types
   - Implement core functionality
   - Add UI components
   - Test the implementation

4. When encountering issues:
   - Create focused prompts with specific error messages or challenges
   - Provide context about the specific architecture and patterns
   - Use the relevant prompt file as a reference

## Quality Assurance

Throughout implementation, ensure:

1. Consistent code style across all packages
2. Comprehensive test coverage
3. Documentation for major components
4. Type safety throughout the application
5. Security best practices
6. Performance optimization

## Architecture Resources

Reference the overall architecture documents:
- [ProjectSetup.md](./ProjectSetup.md): Overall project architecture
- [BackendFiles.Md](./BackendFiles.Md): Backend file structure reference
- [FrontendFiles.md](./FrontendFiles.md): Frontend file structure reference
- [ProjectOverview.md](./ProjectOverview.md): High-level project overview

## Implementation Timeline

Suggested timeline for implementation:

1. **Week 1**: Monorepo setup and shared package implementation
2. **Weeks 2-4**: Backend core functionality
3. **Weeks 5-7**: Frontend development
4. **Weeks 8-9**: Admin dashboard
5. **Weeks 10-12**: Mobile application
6. **Weeks 13-14**: Testing, security, and performance optimization
7. **Week 15**: Deployment pipeline and documentation

By following this guide and using the provided prompts, you'll be able to efficiently implement a standardized, clean architecture for the entire project.

## Progress Update - [May 17, 2025]

We have successfully completed the initial monorepo setup with the following:

1. ✅ Basic monorepo structure with Yarn Workspaces configuration
2. ✅ Set up TypeScript configuration with project references
3. ✅ Created Docker environment with Postgres and Redis
4. ✅ Added Dockerfiles for backend, frontend, and admin services 
5. ✅ Set up utility scripts for project management

### Known Issues
- There's a duplicate AliveHuman folder structure that needs to be resolved
- Environment files need proper configuration based on service requirements

### Next Steps
1. Fix directory structure to remove duplication
2. Initialize Git repository with proper .gitignore
3. Create basic shared package types and utilities
4. Continue with backend setup according to 2-BackendSetup.md guide
5. Set up database schema and initial migration
